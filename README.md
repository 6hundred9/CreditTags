# How to get a tag?
Please, open a pull request adding to `data.yml` your `SHA256` hashed id, such as `example@steam` and your discord username on a comment.

If everything is correct your pull request will be merged and you will receive credits in every server that has the plugin enabled!

Please don't forget to include the `@steam`, `@northwood` or `@discord` part.
